# My (not so efficient) vanity address generator

One morning I woke up and thought it'd be cool to make my own ETH address generator.

Specifically, this generator will ask you for a certain prefix with which the returned address must begin with: once found, it'll give you the private key
to your new and super cool address ;)

## Motivation

There's a couple of reasons why I wanted to make this:

- Whilst reading [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook), I got a glimpse at how
key pairs are generated and addresses derived, so I wanted to use this to make use of what I had just read.
- I always wanted to create addresses with custom-defined prefixes, but could never fully trust an online
resource to do it for me: so I implemented my own, which can be built and run locally with no need for an
internet connection.
- My javascript is pretty bad and rusty so all the practice I can get is useful I guess.

## How to run

You can either:

- Run the executables I built for you and left in the `executables` dir (hopefully the macOS one works, don't have a machine to test it on)
- Build the executable yourself running `pkg package.json` from within the root dir
- Run `node /generator.js` from the src dir or `node src/generator.js` from the root dir

## How to use

Simply run the script and when prompted, enter the hexadecimal prefix you want your new ETH address to have,
with no leading "0x".

Note that the generator treats the given prefix as case-insensitive, and returns the non-checksum form of the address.
